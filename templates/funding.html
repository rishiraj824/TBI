<h3>Quantum of Financial Assistance</h3>

<p>Maximum	: Rs. 50 Lakhs<br>

TBI would enter into a proper agreement with the start-up unit before providing Financial Support (by way of Soft Loan) <br>

As this scheme is applicable only for Incubatees of our TBI, the first logical step would be to apply for Business Incubation Support in our TBI. <br>

<h3>Angel Funding</h3>
<p>VIT-TBI has over the period of years developed contacts with several affluent individuals who provide capital for business start-ups, usually in exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity. VIT-TBI connects its incubatees with Angel Investors as and when the company is ready to assimilate the funds effectively and grow. 
</p>
<h3>Facilitation of Government Grants: </h3>

<p>Funding to the Startups is also arranged through various grants available from the government through various schemes. VITTBI constantly follows the updates from the government e.g. DST, DSIR, DBT, DIT, MSME, TIFAC and the like with respect to funding schemes and recommends appropriate schemes to the incubatees.</p>
